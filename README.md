This is my personal redesign of Adrian Hajdin's Covid tracker, solving through design the recent problems caused by the API and providing an overall more consistent and user-friendly experience.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

See the result in: https://covid19bythenumbers.netlify.app/

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
